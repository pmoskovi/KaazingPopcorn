Extreme HTML5 Video Interactivity: Sending WebSocket Messages with Popcorn.js


One of our most popular demos at Kaazing is using a Web browser on a smartphone to control a physical toy truck from continents away. The truck has a Raspberry Pi attached to it, connecting to a WebSocket server, and listening to control command messages: drive forward or backward, turn left or right, or turn headlight on and off. You can learn more about the project in our Remote Controlling a Car over the Web. Ingredients: Smartphone, WebSocket, and Raspberry Pi blog post.

The most interesting way to demonstrate the truck is by having a remote person control the truck, and join in over a video conference. Hereâ€™s the recording of us doing just this. Fast forward to 4:08 for the truck demo.

Now, there are certain circumstances, when running Skype, or other live video chat apps is not an option. You may be off the grid, or simply not have anybody handy controlling your truck remotely.
